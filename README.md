# Why not other cooler stuff
If you ever check on the source code of the viral libraries like [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) or others, you might lose track on what are they doing and how do they work, so before you go there, it's might be a good idea we start from the beginning.
